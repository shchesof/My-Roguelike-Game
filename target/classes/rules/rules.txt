You are a Gold Miner, so your goal is, obviously, gold.
It is located in one of the rooms. You can open these rooms
only by keys, which you will find during the game. But be
careful, they are guarded by monsters. Luckily, you can kill
monsters by sword or bombs. Don't forget, that you can be
killed by bomb too. You have only 3 moves to run away from the
bomb you put before it goes off. Killing monsters by bomb will
cost you... a bomb. Which you may not have. Killing monsters by
sword will cost you lives, but sometimes you can heal yourself
by lives appearing from the dead monster. Good luck!
